I use Chrome and Safari browser to test it. Sometimes the browser need a few seconds to load the map. 

For this assignment, I put tasks in separated files and I create a header and it can easily get access.

For Task 3, when you type in all address and click submit, it will automatically generate the map.

For bonus part, I use html cache manifest which is a kind of application cache; I create a file called “cache.appcache” to store all the data in it. Once we lose have internet connection, we still can have the content for offline viewing.
